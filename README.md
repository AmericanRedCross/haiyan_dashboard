#Haiyan Dashboard
====================

This dashboard was created by the [American Red Cross](http://redcross.org) and the [British Red Cross](http://redcross.org.uk) for the [International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent](http://ifrc.org) response to assist the [Philippines Red Cross](http://redcross.org.ph) for Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolonda).

The maps, figures, and layers show on this page are public. Additional operational data is secure and can be accessed by logging into the site with credentials provided by the FACT IM team. To get access to the site please send an email to either the FACT IM team or [Dale Kunce](mailto://dale.kunce@redcross.org).
